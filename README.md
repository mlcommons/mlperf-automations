Welcome to the **MLPerf Automations and Scripts** repository! This repository is your go-to resource for tools, automations, and scripts designed to streamline the execution of **MLPerf benchmarks**‚Äîwith a strong emphasis on **MLPerf Inference benchmarks**.

Starting **January 2025**, MLPerf automation scripts are built on the powerful [MLCFlow](https://github.com/mlcommons/mlcflow) automation interface. This modern interface replaces the earlier [Collective Mind (CM)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm), offering a more robust and efficient framework for benchmarking workflows.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Automated Benchmarking** ‚Äì Simplifies running MLPerf Inference benchmarks with minimal manual intervention.
- **Modular and Extensible** ‚Äì Easily extend the scripts to support additional benchmarks and configurations.
- **Seamless Integration** ‚Äì Compatible with Docker, cloud environments, and local machines.
- **MLCFlow (MLC) Integration** ‚Äì Utilizes the MLC framework to enhance reproducibility and automation.

## üß∞ MLCFlow (MLC) Automations

Building on the foundation of its predecessor, the **Collective Mind (CM)** framework, MLCFlow takes ML workflows to the next level by streamlining complex tasks like Docker container management and caching. The `mlcflow` package, written in Python, provides seamless support through both a command-line interface (CLI) and an API, making it easy to access and manage automation scripts.

### Core Automations
- **Script Automation** ‚Äì Automates script execution across different environments.
- **Cache Management** ‚Äì Manages reusable cached results to accelerate workflow processes.
