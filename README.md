Welcome to the **MLPerf Automations and Scripts** repository! This repository is your go-to resource for tools, automations, and scripts designed to streamline the execution of **MLPerf benchmarks**—with a strong emphasis on **MLPerf Inference benchmarks**.

Starting **January 2025**, MLPerf automation scripts is powered by [MLCFlow](https://github.com/mlcommons/mlcflow) automation interface. This new and simplified framework replaces the previous [Collective Mind (CM)](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/tree/master/cm), providing a more robust, efficient, and self-contained solution for benchmarking workflows, making MLPerf automations independent of any external projects.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Automated Benchmarking** – Simplifies running MLPerf Inference benchmarks with minimal manual intervention.
- **Modular and Extensible** – Easily extend the scripts to support additional benchmarks and configurations.
- **Seamless Integration** – Compatible with Docker, cloud environments, and local machines.

## 🧰 MLCFlow (MLC) Automations

Building upon the robust foundation of its predecessor, the Collective Mind (CM) framework, MLCFlow elevates machine learning workflows by simplifying complex tasks such as Docker container management and caching. Written in Python, the mlcflow package offers a versatile interface, supporting both a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) and a flexible API for effortless automation script management.

At its core, MLCFlow relies on a single powerful automation, the Script, which is extended by two actions: CacheAction and DockerAction. Together, these components provide streamlined functionality to optimize and enhance your ML workflow automation experience.
